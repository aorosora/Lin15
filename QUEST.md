# 0, Why is the setting invalid? Become transparent

The current reason is unknown, especially if it only becomes transparent. Please open the log option and send the xposed log to me.

# 1. The click icon is invalid, nothing happens.

There is only one reason for no response, that is, lin15 does not really get the class that can set the background, systemUI has been changed, or it is confused. It can't be found when searching. If this is the case, it is very difficult to adjust the truth, and the individual does not want to adapt.

# 2, the picture cut height is wrong, shorter than the quick setting panel

The height is obtained according to the setting panel. If the height is inconsistent, it should be the height of the acquired height. It is recommended to use the custom height function to clear the previously saved height (set to 0), and then pull down the entire setting panel to the end. Set again

# 3, pull down the quick settings panel does not feel smooth

Normal phenomenon, after all, this picture also accounts for a large part of the memory. Of course, you can adjust your training, and you can tune and close some background apps that you don't use. Of course, personal recommendation is to use low-quality pictures, the picture is not too colorful, after all, the more complicated the drawing, the longer the drawing time.

# 4, I want to submit a log file to the author to troubleshoot the bug

Please send the log file to ```liuzhu234@gmail``` .com as a file. If the click is invalid, you can also send me the systemUI.
