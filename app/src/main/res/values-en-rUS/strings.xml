        Here is the manual for lin15.\n\n

        But all Android 7.0 or 8.0 and can be installed xposed framework ROM can probably set the background image\n\n
        I did not use resource hooks\n
        But written in Java code\n
        \n

        Picture quality, personally think that ordinary quality is enough\n
        The memory is the best half\n
        I can’t see any difference.\n
        Of course, large memory users are free\n\n

        Gaussian blur, you can feel free\n
        The larger the fuzzy value, the more blurred\n\n

        The following features are only for lineageOS15\n
        Please do not be naughty for everyone who is not lineageOS\n

        1、Hide app features\n
        Its entrance is at lineageOS15 official desktop -> HOME SETTINGS(This option appears after long pressing the blank space on the desktop) -> More -> 隐藏应用(Hidden application)
        \n\n


        2、Cancellation pop prompt when you close the mobile data\n
        When you close the mobile data,
        \n
        there will be no more pop-up prompts to close,\n

        but close directly.\n\n


        I am legend\n
        An ingenious developer\n
