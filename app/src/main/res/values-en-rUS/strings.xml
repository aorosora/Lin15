Here is the manual for lin15.\n\n

But all Android 7.0 or 8.0 and can be installed xposed framework ROM can probably set the background image\n\n
I did not use resource hooks\n
But written in Java code\n
\n

Picture quality, personally think that ordinary quality is enough\n
The memory is the best half\n
I can’t see any difference.\n
Of course, large memory users are free\n\n

Gaussian blur, you can feel free\n
The larger the fuzzy value, the more blurred\n\n

Custom height function has been returned\n

For some ROMs, you cannot get the height directly from the drop-down quick settings panel.

If you are always prompted to get the height \n

Then try the custom height\n

The general height is 1200~1400\n

The data is not very accurate\n

Subject to the actual situation of the personal phone \n\n

Background scrolling and reel background features are currently only used as tests\n

Because there are still bugs that can not be solved\n

So leave a switch for you to decide if you do not need it.\n

Resetting the systemUI function is a big trick that is very hurtful.\n

Otherwise it is not recommended to use it unless you want to delete all configurations\n\n

The following features are only for lineageOS15\n
Please do not be naughty for everyone who is not lineageOS\n

1、Hide app features\n
Its entrance is at lineageOS15 official desktop -> HOME SETTINGS(This option appears after long pressing the blank space on the desktop) -> More -> 隐藏应用(Hidden application)
\n\n


2、Cancellation pop prompt when you close the mobile data\n
When you close the mobile data,
\n
there will be no more pop-up prompts to close,\n
but close directly.\n\n
I am legend\n
An ingenious developer\n

Note that after using this function\n
please uninstall the app and restart your phone. \n
This function has another function\n
which is to clear the old traces\n
reset all settings, then your phone will be restored to the way you have never installed lin15\n
everything starts again, it is strongly recommended to restart the phone after reset\n
